The main goal of every stack from Python and beyond is to be able to build a web application capable of full CRUD.

C - Create
R - Read
U - Update
D - Destroy

CREATE - If we have a site that has users' pets, then we need a form for users to submit pets.

READ - For instance, displaying all the pets in the database in a table on the front end (browser).

UPDATE - Allow users to edit their pet's info. We'd better have a form for that.

Destroy - Allow users to delete their pet if they want.
