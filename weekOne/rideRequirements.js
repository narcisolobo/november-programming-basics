The Story: A local theme park has a ride where the rider must be at least 42 inches tall to ride and is over the age of 10. They've hired the development agency you work at to build an app where once it measures a rider's height and age, can display whether the rider is tall enough and old enough to ride the rollercoaster. You've been tasked with building the variables for this app.

Step 1: Identify what variables are needed to determine if a rider can ride the rollercoaster.

Step 2: In VS Code, create those variables.

Step 3: In your same VS Code file, use comments to explain what the variables must be set to in order for the rider to ride.

var requiredHeight = 42; // store the value of required height as a number in inches
var requiredAge = 10; // store the value of required age as a number in years
