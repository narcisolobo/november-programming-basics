# ROCK PAPER SCISSORS

**Toribio and Ryan Von play rock-paper-scissors 10 times. You know that:**

1. Toribio uses rock three times, scissors six times, and paper once.
2. Ryan Von uses rock twice, scissors four times, and paper four times.
3. There are no ties in all 10 games.
4. The order of games is unknown.

**Who wins? By how much?**

**Solutions:** The key to solving this riddle is realizing that Toribio played scissors six times. Because there were no ties, that means Ryan Von didn't play scissors in any of those six games. Now look at the various hands Ryan Von did play. Because he played scissors four times, and none of those could line up with one of the six times Toribio played scissors, he must have played all six of his other hands on Toribio's six scissors.

**Therefore, six of the games, not necessarily in order, were as follows:**

- Toribio: scissors vs. Ryan Von: rock (*Winner: Ryan Von*)
- Toribio: scissors vs. Ryan Von: rock (*Winner: Ryan Von*)
- Toribio: scissors vs. Ryan Von: paper (*Winner: Toribio*)
- Toribio: scissors vs. Ryan Von: paper (*Winner: Toribio*)
- Toribio: scissors vs. Ryan Von: paper (*Winner: Toribio*)
- Toribio: scissors vs. Ryan Von: paper (*Winner: Toribio*)

Now look at what is left over. We see that Ryan Von has only scissors left. Therefore, the other four games are:

- Toribio: rock vs. Ryan Von: scissors (*Winner: Toribio*)
- Toribio: rock vs. Ryan Von: scissors (*Winner: Toribio*)
- Toribio: rock vs. Ryan Von: scissors (*Winner: Toribio*)
- Toribio: paper vs. Ryan Von: scissors (*Winner: Ryan Von*)

**Tally it all up, and Toribio wins, 7 to 3.**
